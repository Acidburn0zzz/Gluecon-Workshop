## The Tao of OpenAPI
- We still have opinions
- Tools rule
- We are still focused on HTTP APIs
- OpenAPI tells you what you can do, not what you can't

- [Servers](./Different/servers.md)
- Parameters 
- [RequestBody](/Different/requestbody.md)
 
## What's fixed
- File
- Forms
- Relative URLs
 
## What's improved
- SecuritySchemes
- Examples
- JSON Schema (anyOf, allOf, nullable)
- URI parameter style
- Path Descriptions
 
## What's new
- Links
- Callbacks
 
## Experiments
- [Reusable groups](./Experiments/GroupRef.yml)
- Alternate schemas
- Support for protocols on top of HTTP
- Support for protocols other than HTTP
- [Operation Versioning](./Experiments/OperationVersioning.yaml)
- [Dynamic Enums](./Experiments/dynamicValues.yaml)
